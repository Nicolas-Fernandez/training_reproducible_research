## Molstar

This extension provides shortcodes for molstar in quarto. Molstar can display macro-molecules such as proteins as well as molcular dynamics trajectories in an interactive viewer. You can see it in action e.g. in the RCSB Protein Data Base: https://www.rcsb.org/, where it provides the 3d view for entries. Follow me, if you want this right in your quarto reports (html only).
